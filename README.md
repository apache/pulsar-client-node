# Pulsar Node.js client library

The Pulsar Node.js client can be used to create Pulsar producers and consumers in Node.js.

## Requirements

Pulsar Node.js client library is based on the C++ client library. Follow the instructions for
[C++ library](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-cpp/) for installing the binaries through
[RPM](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-cpp/#rpm),
[Deb](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-cpp/#deb) or
[Homebrew packages](https://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/client-libraries-cpp/#macos).

(Note: you will need to install not only the pulsar-client library but also the pulsar-client-dev library)

Also, this library works only in Node.js 10.x or later because it uses the
[node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) module to wrap the C++ library.

## Compatibility

Compatibility between each version of the Node.js client and the C++ client is as follows:

| Node.js client | C++ client     |
|----------------|----------------|
| 1.0.0          | 2.3.0 or later |
| 1.1.0          | 2.4.0 or later |

If an incompatible version of the C++ client is installed, you may fail to build or run this library.

## How to install

### Please install pulsar-client in your project:

```shell
$ npm install pulsar-client
```

## Typescript Definitions

```shell
$ npm install @types/pulsar-client --save-dev
```

## Sample code

Please refer to [examples](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node/tree/master/examples).

## How to build

### Install dependent npm modules and build Pulsar client library:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node.git
$ cd pulsar-client-node
$ npm install
```

### Rebuild Pulsar client library:

```shell
$ npm run build
```
