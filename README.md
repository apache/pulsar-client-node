# Pulsar Node.js client library

The Pulsar Node.js client can be used to create Pulsar producers and consumers in Node.js.

This library works only in Node.js 10.x or later because it uses the
[node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) module to wrap the C++ library.

## How to install

> **Note**
>
> These instructions are only available for versions after 1.8.0. For versions previous to 1.8.0, you need to install the C++ client first. Please switch to the corresponding version branch of this repo to read the specific instructions.

### Use `npm`

```shell
npm install pulsar-client
```

### Use `yarn`

```shell
yarn add pulsar-client
```

After install, you can run the [examples](https://github.com/apache/pulsar-client-node/tree/master/examples).

### Prebuilt binaries

The module uses [node-pre-gyp](https://github.com/mapbox/node-pre-gyp) to download the prebuilt binary for your platform, if it exists.
These binaries are hosted on ASF dist subversion. The following targets are currently provided:

Format: `napi-{platform}-{libc}-{arch}`
- napi-darwin-unknown-x64.tar.gz
- napi-linux-glibc-arm64.tar.gz
- napi-linux-glibc-x64.tar.gz
- napi-linux-musl-arm64.tar.gz
- napi-linux-musl-x64.tar.gz
- napi-win32-unknown-ia32.tar.gz
- napi-win32-unknown-x64.tar.gz

`darwin-arm64` systems are not currently supported, you can refer `How to build` to build from source.
